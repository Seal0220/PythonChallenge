"recognize the characters. maybe they are in the book, but MAYBE they are in the page source."


Enter the inspection window to see the source of this page. You will find a hint at the bottom:
<!--

-->
<!--
%%$@_$^__#)^)&!_+]!*@&^}@[@%]()%+$&[(_@%+%$*^@$^!+]!&_#)_*}{}}!}_]$[%}@[{_@#

Replace the url 'ocr.html' with 'equality.html'
